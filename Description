Here's the famous game Wordle
It is coded in Java
I made it for the Coditation system as an Interview Assignment
Head.java is the file where all the logics are implemented
Wordle.java is the main method to run the application
Just install the file and run it on CMD
In CMD type javac Wordle.java
Then type java Wordle.
Happy Playing!!
